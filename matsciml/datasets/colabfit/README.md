# ColabFit Database

[ColabFit](https://colabfit.org), a [KIM Initiative project](https://kim-initiative.org) from the University of Minnesota and New York University, seeks to increase the findability, accessibility, interoperability, and reusability of data-driven interatomic potential (DDIP) data by providing convenient access to well-curated and standardized first-principles datasets. Content on the ColabFit Exchange is open source and freely available.

LMDB files can be downloaded via the ColabFit site or through the [colabfit-cli](https://github.com/colabfit/colabfit-cli) tool. The CLI enables querying across all datasets on the ColabFit Exchange and provides an easy interface to download desired datasets in a MatSciML-ready format.

If you utilize the ColabFit Exchange to access data, please cite the original creators of the dataset you use and refer to [this link](https://colabfit.org/about/) for how to cite ColabFit itself.
